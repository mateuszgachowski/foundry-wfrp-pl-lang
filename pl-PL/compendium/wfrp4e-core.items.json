You use your Charm Skill to Blather. Attempt an <strong>Opposed Charm/Intelligence</strong> Test. Success gives your opponent a Stunned&nbsp;Condition. Further, for each level you have in Blather, your opponent gains another Stunned Condition. Targets Stunned by Blather may do nothing other than stare at you dumbfounded as they try to catch-up with or understand what you are saying. Once the last Stunned Condition comes to an end, the target finally gets a word in, and may not be best pleased with you — after all, you have been talking about nothing or nonsense for some time. Should you stop talking, your opponent immediately loses all Stunned Conditions caused by your Blather. Generally, you can only attempt to Blather at a character once per scene, or perhaps longer as determined by the GM, as the target soon wises up to your antics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
